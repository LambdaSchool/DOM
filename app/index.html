      <h4>Learn By Doing</h4>
      <p class="lora">Unlike most Computer Science programs, we don't start with theory. We start with 
        <em>programming</em>. We jump right into practical knowledge by coding our own applications, then 
        layer in algorithms, abstraction, application architecture, scalability, and theory.<br><br>
        You'll not only learn the practical skills software engineers need to know in order to immediately 
        contribute to an application, but also how to manage large-scale applications, break complex issues
         down into smaller components, solve problems from first principles, and think abstractly.
