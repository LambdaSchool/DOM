                            Lambda School is live streamed from Silicon Valley to a small group of students participating from all over the world. 
                            <br/><br/>
                            Students learn cutting-edge technology from world class instructors at no up-front cost and without having to relocate or acquire expensive housing.
                            <br/><br/>
                            Classes are live, interactive and include one-on-one help, real projects, and frequent code reviews.
