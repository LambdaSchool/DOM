        <h4>Top-Down Education</h4>
        <p>Unlike traditional Computer Science programs, Lambda School teaches computer science principles <i>by programming</i>.
          Instead of starting with theory, we start by building applications, and add on layers of algorithms, abstraction,
          computer architecture, and theory to make our applications better.
          <br> You'll not only learn the practical skills required to become a software engineer, but how to think abstractly
          and solve problems from first principles.</p>
