                <h3>Learn By Doing</h3>
                
                <p>Unlike most Computer Science programs, we don't start with theory. 
                We start with programming. We jump right into practical knowledge by
                 coding our own applications, then layer in algorithms, abstraction, 
                 application architecture, scalability, and theory.</p>
                
                <p>You'll not only learn the practical skills software engineers
                 need to know in order to immediately contribute to an application,
                  but also how to manage large-scale applications, break complex issues 
                  down into smaller components, solve problems from first principles, and think abstractly.</p>
